## Task - 01, 02, 03
## Predictive Modeling, Customer Preference Analysis, Data Visualization

## Project Overview
Building on the insights gained from previous levels, this stage involves developing a predictive model, analyzing customer preferences, and creating visualizations to extract deeper insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives

### Predictive Modeling:
◉ Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.<br>
◉ Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.<br>
◉ Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.<br>

### Customer Preference Analysis:
◉ Analyze the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.<br>
◉ Identify the most popular cuisines among customers based on the number of votes.<br>
◉ Determine if there are any specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.<br>

### Data Visualization:
◉ Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).<br>
◉ Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.<br>
◉ Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.<br>

## Key Insights

### Predictive Modeling:
◉ Various regression models were trained and evaluated.<br>
◉ The Random Forest model outperformed other models with an R^2 score of 0.85.<br>
◉ Features like 'Votes', 'Average Cost for two', and 'Number of cuisines offered' significantly impact the aggregate rating.<br>

### Customer Preference Analysis:
◉ North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food are the most popular cuisines.<br>
◉ North Indian cuisine tends to receive higher ratings on average.<br>
◉ Cuisines with a higher number of votes generally have better ratings.<br>

### Data Visualization:
◉ Histograms and bar plots provided a clear distribution of restaurant ratings.<br>
◉ Scatter plots and heatmaps revealed correlations between features and the target variable.<br>
◉ Geospatial visualizations highlighted regions with higher-rated restaurants.<br>

## Recommendations

### Predictive Modeling:
◉ Use the Random Forest model for predicting restaurant ratings in new datasets.<br>
◉ Regularly update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.<br>
◉ Incorporate additional features like customer reviews to improve model performance.<br>

### Customer Preference Analysis:
◉ Focus on promoting popular cuisines like North Indian and Chinese in marketing strategies.<br>
◉ Introduce high-rating cuisines in regions where they are underrepresented.<br>
◉ Encourage customer feedback to continually refine cuisine offerings.<br>

### Data Visualization:
◉ Use interactive dashboards to make visualizations more engaging for stakeholders.<br>
◉ Regularly update visualizations with new data to monitor trends and performance.<br>
◉ Leverage visualizations to communicate insights and drive data-driven decision-making.<br>

## Conclusion
Level 3 builds on the foundational work of previous levels by adding predictive modeling, deeper customer preference analysis, and enhanced data visualizations. These steps provide actionable insights, enabling more informed strategic decisions in restaurant management and marketing. Regular updates and continued analysis will ensure sustained performance and adaptability to changing market conditions.
